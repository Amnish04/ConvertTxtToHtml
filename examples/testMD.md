Example TIL Post


Today I learned how to review [some else's](https://github.com/kliu57/go-go-web) Open Source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and file issues!

First, I cloned their project on my local machine.

Next, I followed their instructions on how to run the program.

Once I was familiar with how to run the program, I tried to run some edge cases to find bugs.

When I found a bug, I went to the Issues tab of their GitHub project and clicked New issue.

I gave the issue a title and short description as well as a screenshot and submitted the issue.

Have you heard about [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)?
